## Keeper of Elysium

![[Angela Klein, Keeper of Elysium.jpg]]

Angela was once mentored by [[Alonzo Caliburne]] in her years as a younger Kindred. While he preferred outright violence and intimidation as a means to control, Angela became a different kind of animal in her methods. Law, Politics, Clout; these tools allowed her to hunt in the jungles of politics and gave her a reputation as a fierce negotiator and capable of keeping people at the table, even if it required her to do so physically. [[Lucien Burgess]] saw the potential in her attitude and talents, assigning her as both mediator and enforcer of Elysium.

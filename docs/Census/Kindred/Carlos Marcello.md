## The Herald

![[Carlos Marcello, The Herald.jpg]]

Formerly an award winning journalist, Carlos now acts as the Herald of New Orleans. Official witness, voice of the Prince, one time lover of [[Cynthia Hargrave]]. Carlos shuffles through life, seemingly disaffected by both his position in Kindred society and the loss of his passion. Despite his outward appearances and lack of enthusiasm, Carlos is dutiful and remains a reliable member of the Prince's court.

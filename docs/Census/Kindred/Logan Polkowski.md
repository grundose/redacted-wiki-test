## Title

Pic

Burgler turned spy. Logan was sired at the same time as his brother [[Damien Polkowski]] and in fact was responsible for breaking his younger brother out of prison. Always a talented thief and cat burgler, [[Cynthia Hargrave]] saw potential in him as both a shadow to back up his brother and a means to spy on those who might cause her problems. He is blood bound to her, eagerly following orders regardless of what they might be.

## Ventrue Primogen

![[Riemi Tazuka, Ventrue Primogen.jpg]]

A stranger in a strange land turned political power house. Riemi immigrated to New Orleans in 1912 and now sits as one of [[Maxine Baptiste]]'s favorite Primogens to discuss affairs of the city with. She holds a seat on the board of [[Tulane University]], several voting shares in [[Kids First]] and a board seat at [[The Martin Fisher Foundation]]. Her wealth doesn't stop there, nor does her political power. She seems determined to control the entirety of the city, but is currently unwilling to take any stands against [[Maxine Baptiste]] publicly or privately.

## The Fixer

Pic


Ms. Higgins acts as both confidant and advisor for [[Allison Mardis]]. Her rise has been a slow steady climb over the last 75 years, appearing as an orphan kindred in the city of New Orleans and becoming the de facto second-in-command in the Clan Malkavian. Rumor has it that she came to New Orleans to avoid suspicion that she had her sire killed, though the [[Camarilla New Orleans]] has never put an official statement out regarding the matter nor made her the target of a Blood Hunt. Regardless of her origins, she is trusted and protected by [[Allison Mardis]] as well as the rest of the Prince's Court.

## Tremere Primogen

Pic

Tomas DeSante might be the oldest vampire in New Orleans. Originally a Spanish soldier occupying New Orleans, he was faced with living an unlife or giving in to consumption.  He watched as swamps became a shining city, dutifully serving the Camarilla without seeking any furthering of his own station. Politics were a distraction from his studies. Many credit Tomas' work with why the [[Second Inquisition]] never found a foothold in New Orleans. He would say that he merely did what was neccessary. He believes in [[Maxine Baptiste]]'s mission for the city and offers counsel whenever she requires it.

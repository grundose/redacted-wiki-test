## Political Mastermind

Pic

Edit is, in a word, political. She has spent a lifetime, followed by an un-lifetime, gathering boons and information to glide effortlessly across the political landscape. She has access few could ever hope to achieve and enough clout to ensure that she can affect the city she calls home. Though she holds no title or place in the Prince's Court, to take her lightly would be a mistake. Her roots in the city run deep and her power seems borderline absolute.

## Malkavian Primogen

![[Allison Mardis, Malkavian Primogen.jpg]]

Madness is beautiful. Sculptor and painter Allison Mardis believed this as much in life as she does as a kindred. A controlled descent into the strange and the maccabre leads to insight beyond the basic perceptions of the world. This insight has led her through the machiavellian schemes of the court and a rise to the position of Primogen. She has long had the ear of [[Maxine Baptiste]] and petitioned for control of the [[Arts District]]. For now she continues her artistic endeavors while managing her assigned Domain, waiting for the right moment to become known for her to gain what she truly wants.

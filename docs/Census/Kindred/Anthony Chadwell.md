## Toreador Primogen

![[Anthony Chadwell, Toreador Primogen.jpg]]

Anthony wants to rule New Orleans. A fact they neither keep hidden nor remain quiet about. It is not for a lack of respect for the current regime, nor an issue with the Camarilla but a simple drive of greed. They often chafes acting in any official manner as an underling, preferring to enjoy their position as Primogen and enact their will upon the fiefdom that is their Domain. Anthony keeps an iron grip on the Lower Ninth Ward and trusts those beneath him to ensure his authority is respected.

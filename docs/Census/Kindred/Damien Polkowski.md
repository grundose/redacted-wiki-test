Murderer turned bodyguard. Damien and his brother [[Logan Polkowski]] were both sired for the express purpose of playing bodyguard for [[Cynthia Hargrave]]. Damien came from a life of crime and, with the help of his brother, escaped prison in 1984. Unfortunately their safehouse happened to be occupied by [[Carlos Marcello]] who was ordered to turn the brothers over to his Primogen. These days Damien spends every waking moment with his brother to keep [[Cynthia Hargrave]] safe from any threat that may arise. Being blood bound, he is ready to give his life for the Nosferatu Primogen at a moment's notice.

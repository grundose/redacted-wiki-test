## Title

Pic

Dominic has been bitter since the late 1960s. Forced out of his family due to his lack of aging, Dominic reluctantly gave up control of the criminal empire he had built as he folded fully into the world of Kindred. He sees the Camarilla as its own empire to be conquered, but he seems to find opposition at every turn and couldn't be more displeased with the circumstances.

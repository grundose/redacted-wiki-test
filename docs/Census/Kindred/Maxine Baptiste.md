## The Prince of New Orleans

![[Maxine Baptiste.jpg]]

Being the prince of New Orleans isn't a simple task. Not in obtaining the title, not in holding the title, and not without upsetting others who want to take it away from you. Maxine has spent more than a century at the top of her city and there is no end in sight for her reign. She keeps her past mostly to herself, but many older kindred have heard the rumors or witnessed the more historical points of her life. The her ascension to the throne in 1910, the ousting of lupines in the early 1930s and removing her last Seneschal from office for plotting against her in 1972. There are rumors she is to thank for no major Second Inquisition forces establishing themselves in New Orleans, if the Camarilla was in the habit of acknowledging the Inquisition was ever a threat. She is a known Brujah, but has a fierce loyalty for the organization that she has grown up under and used to maintain her iron grip of the Crescent City.

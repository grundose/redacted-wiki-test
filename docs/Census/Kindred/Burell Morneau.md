## Exiled Primogen

![[Burrell Morneau, Exiled Primogen.jpg]]

Burell is in Torpor. At least, that is what most people agree upon. The truth is that he vanished from the public eye after a sealed meeting between [[Maxine Baptiste]], [[Allison Mardis]], and [[Larry Dorset]]. His history of service to the Camarilla is considered generally to be positive, but at the same time there was a lack of outcry when he vanished and [[Allison Mardis]] became the clan Primogen.

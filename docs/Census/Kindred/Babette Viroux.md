## Principal of Faith

![[Babette Viroux.jpg]]

Faith comes in all shapes and forms. Babette acts as the social lubricant to help these various faiths coexist within New Orleans. From devout catholics to fringe occultists, her position at the crossroads ensure all get heard and maybe gain some insight into the faith of their fellow kindred. Her sire, [[Edith Ainsley]], had the idea that she would appreciate the position and the proximity to both Primogens and the Prince that it would provide. Babette can see her rising even further in the future, so long as she continues to show herself as a diplomatic master of often easily agitated parties.
